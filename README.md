# HRMS

## Welcome to my HR management system project called Crescent HRMS.

This project is built using MySQL, NodeJs, ReactJs, and ExpressJs and consists of two portions:

1)Admin portion, which is accessible by admins,and through which they can add, view and delete employees and they can also add new fields.
2)Employee portion, which the employees uses to view their own records.

## Note: I have included a employee.sql file in backend/utils folder, be sure to import it in phpmyadmin or any other database software.
